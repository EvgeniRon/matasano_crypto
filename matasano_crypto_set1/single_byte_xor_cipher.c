/* Cracking single byte XOR cipher */
/* Decrypting the cipher using all keys (byte - 256 options - ascii table). Than scoring each plaintext by calculating the distance between the observed probability of a letter and the letter frequency in the English language. Also, no observation of a letter is penalized - for correct results should not be 0, preferbly 1. Another scoring method is availble - the key that generates the highest count of letters is chosen. User can choose scoringm method by setting distance_scoring. 0 - for distance scoring, else for maximum letters count.
